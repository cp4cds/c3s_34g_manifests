variables:
  Air temperature (ta):
    units: 'K'
    description: 'Temperature of the air.'
  Geopotential height (zg):
    units: 'm'
    description: 'Gravitational potential energy per unit mass normalised by the standard gravity at mean sea level at the same latitude. It is also used as vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level since its value is proportional to the elevation above the mean sea level.'
  U-component of wind (ua):
    units: 'm s-1'
    description: 'Magnitude of the eastward component of the two-dimensional horizontal air velocity.'
  Meridional component of Wind (va):
    units: 'm.s^-1'
    description: 'Magnitude of the meridional (northward) component of the two-dimensional horizontal air velocity.'
